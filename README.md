#Important

Right now i have found a problem, so i have reatored a previouvs version (commit 1201374), but also this version present another problem: 
it work only after arduino reset. I think this is concerned with Serial for the GPS sensor.

I'm working on it.. If you have a solution or suggestion you can send me an email to l.tonghini@gmail.com

Thanks

# OpenLapTimer

OpenLapTimer is an open source project that want to realize an Arduino GPS laptimer for track day.

OpenLapTimer is GPS, because with it we can save the trajectories of each lap and because we don’t need anything on the pitlane wall. The laptimer is thought to stay near the instrument panel with his LCD to show the current laptime.

The laptimer have to log all the GPS points in a file for analyze it in the box. It’s also important log all the session’s lap time.

For more detailed information see the [wiki](https://github.com/tongo/OpenLapTimer/wiki).
